Create a structure of type date that contains three members: the month, the day of the month, and the year, all of type int. (Or use day-month-year order if you prefer.) Have the user enter a date in the format 2/31/2001, store it in a variable of type struct date, then retrieve the values from the variable and print them out in the same format.
