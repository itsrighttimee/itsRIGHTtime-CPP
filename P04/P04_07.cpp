/*


Add a variable of type enum etype (See Que Code P04_06), and another variable of type struct date (See Que Code P04_05) to the employee class of Que Code P04_04. Organize the resulting program so that the user enters four items of information for each of three employees: an employee number, the employeeâ€™s compensation, the employee type, and the date of first employment. The program should store this information in three variables of type employee, and then display their contents.
