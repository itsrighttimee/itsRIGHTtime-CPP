Create a four-function calculator for fractions. 
(answer should be visible in fraction ) 
Here are the formulas for the four arithmetic operations applied to fractions:

Addition: a/b + c/d = (a*d + b*c) / (b*d)
Subtraction: a/b - c/d = (a*d - b*c) / (b*d)
Multiplication: a/b * c/d = (a*c) / (b*d)
Division: a/b / c/d = (a*d) / (b*c)

The user should type the first fraction, an operator, and a second fraction. 
The program should then display the result and ask whether the user wants to continue.
