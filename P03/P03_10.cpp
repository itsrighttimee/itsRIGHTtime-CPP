/*

Write another version of the program from See Que Code P03_07 so that, 
instead of finding the final amount of your investment, 
you tell the program the final amount and it figures out how many years it will take, 
at a fixed rate of interest compounded yearly, to reach this amount. 
What sort of loop is appropriate for this problem? (Donâ€™t worry about fractional years; 
use an integer value for the year.)
